# rock-paper-scissors

This is my first time coding something.
Understanding how to go about the process was difficult,
but using pseudocode to break down the problem was very helpful.

Part1 
I still needed to look up several things.. when to use let vs var, how to compare the strings, how to get the result of the function into console, etc.

I didn't copy any whole solution but used bits and pieces, especially
from old assignments, and also looked up answers to this problem directly 
at times. 

Part2
Creating the multi-round loop was much more challenging, specifically,
getting the result of one round out of the looping function so overall score
could be tracked. Finally succeeded!
