# rock-paper-scissors

This is my first time coding something.
Understanding how to go about the process was difficult,
but using pseudocode to break down the problem was very helpful.

Part1 
I still needed to look up several things.. when to use let vs var, how to compare the strings, how to get the result of the function into console, etc.

I didn't copy any whole solution but used bits and pieces, especially
from old assignments, and also looked up answers to this problem directly 
at times. 

Part2
Creating the multi-round loop was much more challenging, specifically,
getting the result of one round out of the looping function so overall score
could be tracked. Finally succeeded!

Part3
Created the user interface using CSS via DOM manipulation. Significantly reworked code. Changed multi-round mode to play until user or computer reaches 5 points, but can keep score outside of game mode with no limit!
